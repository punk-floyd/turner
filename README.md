# {ðŸ’ˆ} Turner

Turner is a portable, constexpr-friendly C++20 JSON parser library.

It is a header only library with no external dependencies. Eventually it
will also be available as a module.

It's functional, but the API is not yet ready for prime time. Stay tuned.

## Building

To build tests, you'll need [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) installed.
